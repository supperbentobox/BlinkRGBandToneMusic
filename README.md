# BlinkRGBandToneMusic
BlinkRGBandToneMusic is a buzzer player for arduino, tested with ESP32 C3 Zero and a buzzer

it mainly works thanks to the work of https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs 

it plays songs from the repo already mentioned and those converted from MuseScore

the twist is that it adds RBD led to play with it, but you should check what color is more suitable to you

this code has some not so standard language so be aware
